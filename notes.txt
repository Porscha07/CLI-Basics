If you want to learn to code, you MUST learn the command line. Programming languages are advanced ways to control the computer with language. The command line is the baby little brother of programming languages. Learning the command line teaches you to control the computer using language.

Directory - It's a folder used interchangeably with directory.
path- a set of directions to the computer of where you want to put somethingin the tree of directories that make up your computer's hard disk.

If you ever get lost in a directory, type the following:
 pwd- will show you the current directory
 cd ~ - will bring you home

*** Remember when you put quotes around a directory with spaces in it? You can do that with any command. For example, if you have a directory I Have Fun, then you can do: cd "I Have Fun"


*** If you try to do rmdir on Mac OSX and it refuses to remove the directory even though you are positive it's empty, then there is actually a file in there called .DS_Store. In that case, type rm -rf <dir> instead (replace <dir> with the directory name).

***mkdir -p (on Linux/OSX) will make an entire path even if all the directories don't exist.

***8Use the cp -r command to copy more directories with files in them.
***Notice how sometimes I put a / (slash) at the end of a directory? That makes sure the file is really a directory, so if the directory doesn't exist I'll get an error.
